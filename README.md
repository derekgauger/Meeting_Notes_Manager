# Meeting_Notes_Manager
This tool is used to keep track of notes during meetings. It has features to keep track of who said what and a place for additional notes. The results will be outputted into a markdown file.

For the record, I know I could have just used the template to type out the notes, but I'd rather spend the time writing a tool because it is cooler.

Here is how it works:
- Type in a meeting name
- Type in the name of the person speaking
- Type some basic notes about what they are saying
- Press the "Add Notes" button
- Type out the messages for everyone else
- Put in some additional notes
- Press the "Save Notes" button

This will create a markdown file. Originally this script was created to help type up daily scrum meeting notes. If there are any other features you think would be good to add. Message me.
